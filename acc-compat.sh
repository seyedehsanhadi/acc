# 7.2.9: the low-battery warning told an UNPLUGGED run "you're plugged in so charging offsets the
#        short drain tests" -- stated unconditionally, and the advice is the opposite one when
#        there is no charger. Found by running the whole script with no cable and reading what
#        it actually said.
# 7.2.8: audit of every LEVELOK consumer, not just the ones that were reported. The RECOMMENDED
#        pick took the FIRST entry unfiltered, so a read-only node could be recommended as a
#        switch; two report branches listed (ro) entries under wording that says the node
#        ACCEPTS values; and five more sites re-derived the filter by hand. LEVELOK now has
#        exactly two named views -- level_writable (took a value) and level_enf (enforces) --
#        and every consumer uses one of them.
# 7.2.7: the fourth and last copy of "gate set before the router decided" -- firmware-combo
#        still preset cheld, so a refused verdict spent a resume wait AND suppressed the
#        pair-combo layer that should run when nothing held. The Deep "ALL WORKING SWITCHES"
#        list printed LEVELOK raw, advertising (ro)/(accepts) level nodes as working. And the
#        combo engine admitted only trusted NAMES while 6c/SUPER already test vendor nodes by
#        shape, so a pair that only holds together could never be built.
# 7.2.6: the combo minimizer existed twice and only one copy got 7.2.5's slow-node re-check, so
#        the teach path still dropped a required node after a single 6s look. There is now one
#        minimize_combo(). resume_check is gated on the ROUTER accepting the verdict rather
#        than on the hold alone, so a refused NOT-HELD/THROTTLE no longer spends minutes
#        waiting to re-arm a node that was never recorded. level_enf emits one label per line
#        instead of gluing them, and the third hand-rolled copy of that filter now calls it.
# 7.2.5: verdict routing. A verdict that is not a hold (NOT-HELD from the coulomb veto, or a
#        THROTTLE) used to fall through route_hit/route_stab's `*)` arm and be recorded as a
#        working CUT, config line and all. Both routers now refuse it, and GENHITS/BUILT only
#        record a hit the router accepted. chg_now no longer takes a status string for a
#        current, the trickle window is a THROTTLE rather than a CUT, label_path strips any
#        [TAG] prefix, level_enf is the single definition of "a level node that enforces",
#        present_now waits for IDLE to be learned, 4c tests grouped switches, and the
#        classifiers moved above --selftest so 23 new cases can reach them.
# 7.2.4: --unplug calls itself "Highest-accuracy (Deep + unplug)", estimates 10-20 minutes and
# refuses every early exit -- while running on quick's caps and quick's deadline. Either the label
# or the budget was wrong; the label is what the user chose, so give it Deep's budget.

  # it re-arms that vote to the USB default rather than to what it had negotiated. The snapshot
  # replay puts the right value back and it READS BACK CORRECTLY -- so nothing above notices -- and
  # then the firmware pulls it down again seconds later, after the replay has finished looking.
  # Measured on a Pixel 6a: the run finished with "restored", main-charger/current_max at 500000
  # instead of 3200000, charger input 478 mA instead of 1418 mA, and it stayed that way for an hour
  # until the value was written back by hand. Look once more, late, after everything has settled.
  #
  # Charger-side supplies only. usb, tcpm* and pc_port carry the NEGOTIATED contract rather than a
  # vote, and writing one renegotiates the link: measured, a single write to usb/current_max dropped
  # the port to 100000 (100 mA, unconfigured) and charging stopped until it was written back.
  #
  # And only on a COLLAPSE, not a deviation. A charger that re-arms to 1800000 against a snapshot of
  # 1900000 is a live actuator tracking its own state (the Mi A3 does exactly this every run) and is
